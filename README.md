n-dimensional-lists
===================
N-Dimensional Singley Linked Lists

This is a real implementation, not some shoddy list of lists approach.

test.cpp contains an example. 

What it does:
Fill from (0, 0, 0) => (4, 4, 4) in shortest path mode  
Then fill again from (4, 4, 4) => (8, 8, 8)

ie. rather then a direct traversal down each dimension, it completes the first one, then does the second.
